## ML study project with deployment to docker container

It was desined according to Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP)

1. This Project includes data analisys
2. Data preparation (feature engineering)
3. Modeling based on notebook/model_training.py, where you can find methods for
evaluation the most suitable algorithm and tuning hyperparameters 
4. Model evaluation based on notebooks/model_evaluation.py
5. Deployment trained models into Docker container
